# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will extract color values from the existing style.css file and create a separate theme system that allows for dynamic stylesheet swapping. The system will enable users to switch between different color themes (starting with a "default" theme) without requiring application restarts or page reloads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to switch between different color themes, so that I can customize the visual appearance of the application to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL apply the default theme automatically
2. WHEN a user selects a different theme THEN the system SHALL update the visual appearance immediately without requiring a page reload
3. WHEN a theme is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the user's theme preference for future sessions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want color values to be centralized in theme files, so that I can easily create and maintain different color schemes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new theme THEN all color values SHALL be defined in a single theme file
2. WHEN the main stylesheet is loaded THEN it SHALL reference theme variables instead of hardcoded color values
3. WHEN a color needs to be updated THEN it SHALL only require changes in the theme file, not the main stylesheet

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme system to preserve all existing visual functionality, so that changing themes doesn't break the application's appearance or usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any theme is applied THEN all existing visual elements SHALL maintain their intended styling and layout
2. WHEN switching themes THEN interactive states (hover, selected, cursor) SHALL continue to work correctly
3. WHEN a theme is applied THEN all color-dependent features (search results, node states, dates) SHALL remain visually distinct and functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a theme selection interface, so that I can easily choose and preview different themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing theme settings THEN the system SHALL provide a user interface for theme selection
2. WHEN previewing a theme THEN the system SHALL show the theme name and allow immediate application
3. WHEN a theme is selected THEN the interface SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the selection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme system to be extensible, so that new themes can be added easily in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new theme THEN it SHALL only require creating a new theme file following the established structure
2. WHEN a new theme file is added THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and make it available for selection
3. WHEN defining theme variables THEN the system SHALL use a consistent naming convention that maps clearly to CSS properties
